  <h2>Old guitar</h2>

  <p>
    Found an old guitar in the trash―<br>
    Does anyone know its name?<br>
    Searched near and far and Google'd no match,<br>
    but I'll love it all just the same.
  </p>

  <p>
    Brought it home, it smelled like sin,<br>
    and scrubbing with IPA,<br>
    prayed to god but some's still in,<br>
    so I'm letting it sit a day.
  </p>

  <p>
    Slowly I'll learn the chords and keys,<br>
    and cobble together a tune.<br>
    Day by day I practice in the trees,<br>
    sure to be a master by June.
  </p>

  <p>
    Said "Gather round," to a crowd,<br>
    "for I'll soon have wealth and fame!"<br>
    As I played they sang praises out loud,<br>
    while thinking that I was lame.
  </p>

  <p>
    Then one day I met a fine young lady―<br>
    Suddenly, she'd lit my fuse.<br>
    Fingers a-strumming with the love she gave me,<br>
    finally I'd met my muse.
  </p>

  <p>
    Trying my best, the notes coalesced,<br>
    into days of unbridaled focus.<br>
    Vocals blessed and chords progressed,<br>
    I wrote my magnum opus.
  </p>

  <p>
    Spotlight shining, nearly blinding,<br>
    I rushed out to the stage.<br>
    The night flashed by and now I'm finding,<br>
    I've made the news front page!
  </p>

  <p>
    Filled with pride and joy beyond all measure,<br>
    I reflect back on my start:<br>
    For one man's trash is another man's treasure,<br>
    when you've got at least a bit of heart.
