  <h2>Trash guitar</h2>

  <p>
    Found an old guitar in the trash―<br>
    Does anyone know its name?<br>
    Searched near and far and Google'd no match,<br>
    but I will love it just the same.
  </p>

  <p>
    Brought it home, it smelled like sin,<br>
    and scrubbing with rubbing IPA,<br>
    prayed to god but there's some still in,<br>
    so I'mm'a have it sit for a day.
  </p>

  <p>
    Slowly I will learn the chords and keys,<br>
    maybe hack together a tune.<br>
    Day by day I practice midst the trees,<br>
    and I hope to shred by June.
  </p>

  <p>
    Said "Gather round," to a crowd,<br>
    "for I'll soon have wealth and fame!"<br>
    And as I played they sang their praises out loud,<br>
    while thinking secretly I'm lame.
  </p>

  <p>
    Then one day I met a fine young lady―<br>
    Suddenly, she'd lit my fuse.<br>
    Fingers strumming with the love that she gave me,<br>
    finally I'd met my muse.
  </p>

  <p>
    Trying my best, the notes coalesced,<br>
    into days of furied focus.<br>
    Vocals blessed and all the chords progressed,<br>
    I manifest my magnum opus.
  </p>

  <p>
    Spotlight shining, nearly blinding,<br>
    I rushed out right onto the stage.<br>
    The night flashed by and now I'm finding,<br>
    I've made the goddamn news front page!
  </p>

  <p>
    Filled with pride and joy beyond all measure,<br>
    I look back on my humble start:<br>
    For one man's trash is another man's treasure,<br>
    when you've got just a bit of heart.
