    Mosaic Tetris was a game played from the terminal that I made as my first
    introduction to the Go programming language. It is similar to Tetris, except
    you can put the pieces anywhere on the board and they don't fall down. The
    catch: the pieces cannot be rotated.

    You can download Mosaic Tetris from
    <a href="https://pilosophos.com/software/mosaic-tetris">my main website</a>
    or, if you're already on tilde.town, play it with the command
    <code>town mosaic-tetris</code>.
